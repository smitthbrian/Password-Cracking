# Password Cracking: Understanding Security and Attack Methods

## Overview  
This project explores the process of password cracking using ethical hacking techniques. It is designed to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences by showcasing real-world password vulnerabilities and best practices for security.  

## Key Topics  
- **Windows Authentication & NTLM Hashing**  
- **Packet Capture & Hash Extraction with Wireshark**  
- **Password Cracking using Hashcat**  
- **Dictionary, Hybrid, and Brute Force Attacks**  
- **GPU Acceleration in Password Cracking**  
- **Security Recommendations & Best Practices**  

## Tools & Environment  
- **Windows & Kali Linux Virtual Machines**  
- **Wireshark for Packet Capture**  
- **Hashcat for Password Cracking**  
- **RockYou Wordlist for Dictionary Attacks**  
- **GPU Acceleration (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti Used for Testing)**  

## Attack Demonstrations  
### 1. Capturing NTLM Hashes  
- Using Wireshark to intercept authentication traffic and extract NTLMv2 password hashes.  

### 2. Dictionary Attack  
- Running Hashcat against common password lists to crack weak credentials.  

### 3. Hybrid Attack  
- Combining dictionary words with additional characters to guess more complex passwords.  

### 4. Brute Force Attack  
- Attempting to crack passwords by testing all possible character combinations.  

## Results  
- **Weak passwords (e.g., "sunshine") cracked in seconds.**  
- **Moderate passwords (e.g., "Johnny2311*") cracked with dictionary-based techniques.**  
- **Strong passwords (e.g., "O;dC1>}db9I83") resisted all cracking attempts.**  
- **Brute force attacks took an impractical amount of time without significant GPU power.**  

## Lessons Learned  
- Short, simple passwords are easily cracked.  
- Length and complexity significantly increase security.  
- GPUs dramatically speed up password cracking but have limits.  
- Proper password hygiene is essential to preventing breaches.  

## Conclusion  
This project highlights the importance of password security and demonstrates how attackers exploit weak credentials. By understanding these techniques, users can better protect their accounts from unauthorized access.
